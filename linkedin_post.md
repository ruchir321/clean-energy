Building a Data-Driven View of Canada's Renewable Energy Future — Technical Summary

This project focused on producing rigorous, reproducible technical insights from the IRENA dataset for Canada (cleaned to 2015–2024). Our aim was to create a defendable forecasting baseline and share artifacts suitable for stakeholder communication and reproducible research.

Core technical work

- Data ingestion & cleaning: We standardized the IRENA extract into two pivoted CSVs (`cleaned_capacity_data.csv` and `cleaned_generation_data.csv`), handling missing values and unit consistency. The data pipeline is captured in `Data-Ingestion.ipynb`.
- Exploratory analysis: We computed year-over-year growth, renewable vs non-renewable shares, and technology mixes. Key visualizations show robust growth in solar PV and onshore wind capacity and the changing share of renewables in total capacity.
- Time-series modeling: We implemented ARIMA-based forecasting (5-year horizon) in `arima_forecast.ipynb`. Implementation notes:
	- Primary model selection via `pmdarima.auto_arima` when available; a `statsmodels` SARIMAX fallback is used to ensure reproducibility across environments.
	- Annual frequency models (Year index) with automatic differencing and order selection; forecasts include 95% prediction intervals.
	- Short series are handled defensively (repeat-last fallback) to avoid noisy fits.

Artifacts saved for sharing

To create concise visuals and tables suitable for a LinkedIn showcase, run the provided script `generate_showcase.py`. It produces:

- `showcase/capacity_trends.png` — total renewable vs non-renewable capacity (2015–2024).
- `showcase/generation_trends.png` — generation trends by major technologies.
- `showcase/top_tech_share.png` — stacked contribution of renewable technologies in the latest year.
- `showcase/arima_forecast_example.png` — example historical + 5-year forecast for a selected technology (if forecast CSVs exist).
- `showcase/forecast_tables.csv` — combined forecast tables (generation & capacity) where available.

How to reproduce (quick)

1. Install dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pmdarima
```

2. Run the showcase generator from the repository root:

```bash
python generate_showcase.py
```

This will create the `showcase/` directory with PNGs and CSVs ready for sharing.

Technical takeaways

- Renewable capacity trends: Solar PV and onshore wind show the strongest multi-year growth; hydropower remains a steady base but exhibits lower year-over-year growth.
- Generation shifts: The generation mix is evolving; forecasting highlights potential short-term increases in renewables' share under a business-as-usual trajectory.
- Modeling caveats: Annual ARIMA models provide useful baseline projections but miss intra-year seasonality. For higher fidelity, switch to monthly/quarterly models and incorporate exogenous signals (policy changes, demand forecasts, storage deployment).

Collaboration & reproducibility

Version control and collaborative workflows were integral: notebooks, data, and scripts are tracked in GitHub with PR-based reviews to ensure traceability.
